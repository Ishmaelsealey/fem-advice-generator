## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt that I way overestimated how long this project would take me, simply because I just assumed it would be harder
since I had to use an API. I was quite wrong in my assumption as it took me only 1 hour 45 mins to create,
though my "guess" was 8 hours!
